# CNN Model for SeeDigits

This repository contains the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture and the trained model file used for the [SeeDigits](https://seedigits.vercel.app) site.

## Contents

1. **`mnist_model.onnx`**:  
   The trained ONNX model file that powers digit recognition on the SeeDigits site.

2. **Model Architecture**:  
   A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify handwritten digits, trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Usage

You can use the model file in this repository to perform digit recognition tasks in any project that supports ONNX. The file is located in the `model/` directory:

**Path to the ONNX model:**
